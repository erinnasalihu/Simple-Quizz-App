# Simple-Quizz-App


Description

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a simple quiz application in the terminal. The program collects basic user data (name, age, city), validates the inputs, and then runs a short math quiz with randomly generated questions. At the end, a summary is displayed showing the user information and quiz score.

This project is designed as a final proof-of-knowledge task, demonstrating the application of core Python concepts including functions, data structures, user input handling, control flow, and random generation.



How to Run

	1.	Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
	2.	Download or clone the project folder.
	3.	Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
	4.	Run the program using the following command:

python main.py



Requirements Fulfilled

	•	Chosen topic: A simple math quiz app with user registration.
	•	At least 4 separate functions:
	•	get_user_info() – collects and validates user input
	•	generate_question() – creates random math questions
	•	run_quiz() – manages the flow of the quiz
	•	show_summary() – displays the quiz results and user info
	•	Data structures:
	•	dictionary used to store user data
	•	list used in looping questions
	•	User input and validation:
	•	Validates name (not empty) and age (numeric and reasonable)
	•	Control flow:
	•	Uses if/else conditions for validation
	•	Uses for loops to manage quiz repetition
	•	Random generation:
	•	Math questions are generated using random numbers and operators



GitHub Structure
	•	main.py – Main script that contains all logic
	•	README.md – This file, explaining project purpose, setup, and requirement mapping
